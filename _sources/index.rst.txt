QuantUS Documentation
=====================

**QuantUS** is a desktop application and command line interface (CLI) aiming to combine and analyze 
ultrasonic data regardless of system and format. The tool supports quantitative ultrasound 
spectroscopy (QUS) on radiofrequency (RF) and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data. It also 
features 2D/3D dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) time intensity curve (TIC) analysis 
for monitoring bolus injections of contrast over time. 

Notably, QuantUS addresses gaps in existing 
tools by uniquely featuring 3D DCE-US perfusion parametric map generation, motion compensation for 
2D DCE-US cine loops with TIC analysis, an ultrasound system-independent approach, and an 
intuitive user interface. Parametric maps can be computed for all forms of analysis, adding a 
qualitative aspect to research projects.
