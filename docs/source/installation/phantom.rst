================================
Phantom Collection Google Folder
================================

This folder contains minimal sample data required to get each feature of
QuantUS working. Note that since phantom data must be collected using
identical transducer settings as the images they're compared to, we
do not recommend using phantoms from this folder for analysis on custom
data.

This dataset can be installed locally using our Python virtual environment. Specifically, the commands for installation are

.. code-block:: shell

   [conda activate QuantUS-env | source venv/bin/activate | call venv\Scripts\activate.bat]
   python sampleData.py
