QuantUS is a free, standalone, native graphical user interface (GUI) facilitating ultrasound research compatible on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux. The tool provides an end-to-end workflow for analysis using radiomics approaches including:

* 2D Ultrasound Tissue Characterization (UTC) via spectral analysis of radiofrequency (RF) and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data
* 2D Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) Time Intensity Curve (TIC) Analysis with optional Motion Compensation
* 3D CEUS TIC Analysis

Notably, QuantUS addresses shortcomings in existing state-of-the-art tools by supporting 3D parametric map generation, motion compensation for 2D CEUS TIC analysis, an ultrasound system-independent approach, and an intuitive user interface. For more information, see our [website](https://quantus.webflow.io).

## UTC Overview (Quantitative Ultrasound Approach)

Given user-inputted RF or IQ ultrasound data, this feature runs spectral analysis to compute quantitative ultrasound parameters and parametric maps on a custom region of interest (ROI). In QuantUS, the midband fit (MBF), spectral slope (SS), and spectral intercept (SI) spectral parameters as described by [El Kaffas et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26233222/) have been validated and used in numerous ultrasound studies. Additionally, the backscatter coefficient, attenuation coefficient, Nakagami parameter, effective scatterer size, and effecive scatterer concentration have all been implemented into the UI and are in the validation process.

The UTC feature of QuantUS also supports a CLI for Terason and Canon transducers. More information and an example can be found in [scCanonUtc.ipynb](CLI-Demos/scCanonUtc.ipynb) and [terasonUtc.ipynb](CLI-Demos/terasonUtc.ipynb).

## CEUS Overview (Bolus Injection Analysis)

For both 2D and 3D cine loops, QuantUS performs quantitative analysis on bolus contrast injections by computing a TIC for a given ROI or volume of interest (VOI). 2D cine loops can optionally run a 2D motion compensation algorithm developed by [Tiyarattanachai et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35970658/) before the TIC is computed to reduce motion-induced noise.

From here, a lognormal curve is fitted, returning the area under the curve (AUC), peak enhancement (PE), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TP), normalization (TMPPV), and region area/volume values. For processors with high computational power, a parametric map of each parameter can be generated in both 2D and 3D as well.

## Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) (preferred)

## Environment

### Conda (preferred)

Once you have Conda installed on your machine (Miniconda and Anaconda Distribution each suffice), use `env.yml` to create a conda-enabled virtual environment. This can be completed using the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TUL-Dev/QuantUS.git
cd QuantUS
conda env create -f env.yml
```

From here, this environment can be activated using the `conda activate QuantUS-env` command.

### VirtualEnv (deprecated)

Deprecated but continued for historic purposes, this environment uses `pip` and the `virtualenv` Python library to create a Pip-enabled virtual environment. This can be completed using the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TUL-Dev/QuantUS.git
cd QuantUS
pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --python="python3.9" venv
source venv/bin/activate # Unix
call venv\bin\activate.bat # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Following this example, this environment can be accessed via the `source venv/bin/activate` command from the repository directory.

#### Troubleshooting for Mac

To run these commands, make sure you have [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

If you encounter an error after running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, try the following code and then run the command again:

```shell
brew install qt5

brew link qt5 --force

pip install wheel setuptools pip --upgrade

pip install pyqt5==5.15.9 --config-settings --confirm-license= --verbose
```

If an error persists after running `python main.py`, try `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qt@5/5.15.13_1/plugins`.

## Building

After configuring a Python virtual environment, finish preparing QuantUS to be run using the following commands:

```shell
# Using Python virtual env (Mac/Linux)
chmod +x saveQt.sh
./saveQt.sh

# Using Python virtual env (Windows)
ren saveQt.sh saveQt.bat
.\saveQt.bat
```

### Extra step for Windows

To finish preparing QuantUS to be run, to support the Philips RF parser, compile `src\Parsers\philips_rf_parser_windows.c` into a `src\Parsers\philips_rf_parser.exe` executable using Windows C compiler of choice.

## Running

### Mac/Linux

```shell
[conda activate QuantUS-env | source venv/bin/activate]
python main.py
```

### Windows

```shell
[conda activate QuantUS-env | call venv\scripts\activate.bat]
python main.py
```

## Phantom Collection Google Folder

This folder contains minimal sample data required to get each feature of
QuantUS working. Note that since phantom data must be collected using
identical transducer settings as the images they're compared to, we
do not recommend using phantoms from this folder for analysis on custom
data.

### Installation

This dataset can be installed locally using our Python virtual environment. Specifically, the commands for installation are

```shell
[conda activate QuantUS-env | source venv/bin/activate | call venv\Scripts\activate.bat]
python sampleData.py
```
