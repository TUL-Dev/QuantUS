# Quantitative Ultrasound Tool

## Overview

This program supports spectral tissue characterization analysis on 2D radiofrequency (RF) and in-phase and quadrature phase (IQ) data.

Additionally, it supports 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) analysis for bolus injections. The 2D software uses motion correction software developed by [Thodsawit Tiyarattanachai MD, PhD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35970658/). Currently, the 3D software does not have motion correction software, but enables users to manually edit their time intensity curve (TIC) as shown in the tutorial below.
